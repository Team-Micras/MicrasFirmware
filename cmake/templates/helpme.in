Project Variables:
    When running the cmake command, you can set the following variables
    by adding `-D {VARIABLE}={VALUE}` after `cmake ..` in the terminal:
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:   Set the project build type
                        Possible values: Debug, Release (default: Debug)
    CMAKE_LINTER:       Set clang-tidy linter mode
                        Possible values: ON, OFF, FIX (default: OFF)

Current configuration:
    PROJECT NAME    =   ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}
    IOC FILE        =   ${PROJECT_RELEASE}.ioc
    DEVICE          =   ${DEVICE}
    BUILD TYPE      =   ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}
    LINTER          =   ${CMAKE_LINTER}
